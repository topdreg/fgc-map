<h2>Project Description</h2> 
This application, developed as a project for Udacity's FullStack Developer Nanodegree, is a neighborhood map of California identifying areas that the fighting game community (Street Fighter, etc.) reguarly meets at to have fun. The inspiration to develop this comes from my own interest in fighting games, and the lack of any good central resource to find areas to play against other fighting game enthusiasts. Thus, this app will be a continuous work in-progress! When I find locations, and if the location has good API data from Foursquare, then I'll update the app with those locations. They aren't easy to find though, in my opinion. 

<h2>Getting Started</h2> 
To run the application, just go to https://topdreg.github.io/fgc-map/. Alternatively, clone the repository and run index.html on your local computer. 

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
